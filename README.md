I created a personal blog using Blazor, Entity Framework, SQL Server, and authentication and authorization. It includes features such as login functionality, a CRUD for posts, a view where users can see all blog posts, and a filter to sort posts by month.

On the first page of the blog, there is a brief introduction about me and a button to redirect users to the blog.

I came up with this blog idea, and I find it incredibly interesting. Now, I want to create videos about the topics I publish on this blog. These days, blogs are "in the hype," and with videos, I can present the content more dynamically and make it more engaging for people to watch.
